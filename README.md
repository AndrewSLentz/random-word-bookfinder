#Random Word Bookfinder
We knew that we wanted an app that combined data from multiple APIs in a unique, interactive way. Because there are many book and word APIs available, this avenue seemed promising.

We conceptualized an app that allows a user to either generate a random word or search one of their choosing, and provides both a dictionary definition and several books that the word occurs in- because the best way of learning a word is by seeing it in context.

##Design considerations

For an app designed with words and definitions in mind, we wanted a super-clean, non-busy user interface. Straight lines and square corners project professionalism. The background is a softened white and text a softened black with accents such as buttons and borders in a grayish-blue.

It makes sense for the search/generate user interface to be the first things the user sees. On desktop, the hope is to have the dictionary definition and book suggestions side-by-side so the user does not have to scroll to get full functionality. On mobile, these will be stacked vertically with the definition occurring first in the page.
